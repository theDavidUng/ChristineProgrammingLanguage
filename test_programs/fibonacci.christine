christine is breaking a program named fibonacci;
christine is creating a method that returns integer called getFib (christine eats n as integer) {
    christine eats i as integer;
    christine eats j as integer;
    christine eats k as integer;
    christine eats t as integer;
    christine sticks 0 into i;
    christine sticks 1 into j;
    christine sticks 1 into k;
    christine repeats herself until (k equal to n)
    {
        christine sticks (christine puts i and j together) into t;
        christine says {j, " "};
        christine sticks j into i;
        christine sticks t into j;
        christine sticks (christine puts 1 and k together) into k;
    }
    christine says { j, "\n"};
    christine is returning j;
}
christine is doing her main thing {
    christine eats fib as integer;
    # Get a sequence of 5 numbers
    christine says {"christine is calling getFib with a value of 5\n"}
    christine sticks (christine casually strolls to getFib with 5;) into fib;
    christine says {"result of getFib for 5 is ", fib, "\n"};
    # Get a sequence of 15 numbers
    christine says {"christine is calling getFib with a value of 15\n"}
    christine sticks (christine casually strolls to getFib with 15;) into fib;
    christine says {"result of getFib for 15 is ", fib, "\n"};
}
